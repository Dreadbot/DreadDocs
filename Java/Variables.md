# Variables

A `variable` is kind of like a named box that holds something.

Here is a quick example in Java:
```java
boolean isRobotOn = false;
```
To create a variable, you need 4 things:
* You need a `type`, a `type` tells us what that "something" is. In this case our `type` is a `boolean` which stores either a true or false.
* You need a name, which in this case is `isRobotOn`, you will use this name to refrence the variable later.
* You need an equals sign, this is how we tell Java that we want to assign a variable to a value.
* And lastly, you need a value, which in this case is `false`.

## Common Types in Robot Programming and Their Values

Type | Value
--- | ---
`int` | Whole numbers (such as 1, 2, -3, etc.)
`double` | Numbers with a decimal (such as 1.234)
`boolean` | Can be true or false
